🧮 Calculator (Java)
📌 Project Description

Calculator is a Java-based application that performs basic arithmetic operations using a simple and user-friendly approach.
The project is developed to demonstrate the practical use of Java fundamentals, especially Scanner for user input, switch-case statements for operation selection, and data types for calculations.

This repository serves as an excellent learning project for beginners who want to strengthen their understanding of core Java concepts through a real-world example.

➕ Supported Operations

The calculator supports the following arithmetic operations:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

The user selects the desired operation, and the program performs the calculation accordingly using a switch-case structure.
